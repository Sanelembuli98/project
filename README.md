# Code Description
This code is an example of training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The code performs the following steps:

1. Preprocesses the training images by resizing, converting to grayscale, applying histogram equalization, and normalizing pixel values.
2. Loads the corresponding labels for the images, assuming the labels are in the YOLO format.
3. Reshapes and normalizes the training images using StandardScaler.
4. Defines a CNN model architecture using Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, and Dense layers.
5. Compiles and trains the model using the training images and labels.
6. Evaluates the model's performance on the training and validation data by printing accuracy and loss values for each epoch.
7. Generates a confusion matrix based on the predictions made by the model.
8. Loads new test images, preprocesses them, and predicts their labels using the trained model.

# Requirements
To run this code, you need to have the following requirements and packages installed:

1. Python (version 3.6 or higher)
2. OpenCV (cv2)
3. NumPy
4. scikit-learn
5. TensorFlow (version 2.x)

# Usage
1. Set the appropriate directory paths for the dataset, including images and labels.
2. Define the number of classes and their corresponding class names.
3. Run the code to load and preprocess the images and labels.
4. Train the CNN model using the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance by analyzing accuracy and loss values.
6. Visualize the confusion matrix.
7. Load and preprocess new test images to predict their labels using the trained model.
8. Save the trained model.

Note: Make sure to have the dataset with images and labels in the specified directory structure before running the code.

# Additional Notes
- Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters as needed for your specific classification task.
- Customize the preprocessing steps and label processing based on your dataset's format.
- Modify the class labels, class names, and any other relevant information based on your dataset.

# Common mistakes 
1. Incorrect file paths:
   - Mistake: Providing incorrect file paths for the dataset, images, or labels directories.
   - Resolution: Double-check the file paths and ensure they point to the correct directories. Verify that the dataset structure matches the expected directory structure in the code.

2. Image preprocessing errors:
   - Mistake: Applying incorrect preprocessing steps or not handling image files of different formats.
   - Resolution: Ensure that the preprocessing steps are appropriate for your specific dataset. Verify that images are loaded and processed correctly, including resizing, converting to grayscale, applying histogram equalization, and normalization.

3. Label processing errors:
   - Mistake: Misinterpreting or mishandling the label file contents, such as incorrect parsing or assuming a different label format.
   - Resolution: Verify the label file format and adjust the label processing code accordingly. Make sure the label processing steps match the specific format and structure of your labels.

4. Inconsistent number of images and labels:
   - Mistake: The code doesn't handle cases where the number of loaded images and labels is not the same.
   - Resolution: Add error handling code to ensure that the number of loaded images and labels is consistent. You can raise a ValueError or implement an appropriate mechanism to handle this situation.

5. Mismatched image dimensions:
   - Mistake: Reshaping the images to an incorrect shape or not adjusting the model architecture to match the reshaped images.
   - Resolution: Double-check the expected input shape for the model and ensure that the images are reshaped accordingly. Update the model architecture to accept the correct input shape.

6. Incorrect number of classes or labels:
   - Mistake: Providing an incorrect number of classes or assuming a different label format, leading to incorrect model compilation or training.
   - Resolution: Check the number of classes and ensure it matches the actual number of classes in your dataset. Adjust the model architecture and output layer to have the correct number of units.

7. Saving the model:
   - Mistake: Not specifying the correct file path or format when saving the trained model.
   - Resolution: Verify that the file path and file name provided for saving the model are correct and accessible. Ensure that the specified format, such as ".h5" or ".pb", matches the desired format for saving the model.

These are some common mistakes that can occur when writing code for image classification. It's important to thoroughly test and validate the code to ensure it behaves as expected and produces the desired results.

# Data Set

## Dataset Documentation: YOLO Format (Annotated with Roboflow)
Dataset Overview
This dataset is annotated in YOLO format and was generated using Roboflow, an annotation tool commonly used for computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of a collection of images with corresponding label files, where each label file contains the annotations for the objects present in the corresponding image. The annotations include bounding box coordinates and class labels for each object of interest within the image.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized in the following structure:
- dataset_directory
    - images
        - image1.jpg
        - image2.jpg
        - ...
    - labels
        - image1.txt
        - image2.txt
        - ...
    The dataset_directory is the main directory containing the dataset.
    The images directory contains the images used for training or evaluation. These images are in a common image format such as JPEG or PNG.
    The labels directory contains the annotation files corresponding to each image. The annotation files are in text format (e.g., .txt) and have the same name as their corresponding image files. 

    The annotations in this dataset follow the YOLO (You Only Look Once) format. YOLO format represents object annotations using bounding boxes, where each bounding box is defined by a set of parameters:
    0 0.512 0.345 0.235 0.415
    1 0.170 0.675 0.120 0.320
